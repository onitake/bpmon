![BPMON](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unprofession-al/bpmon/master/bpmon.png "BPMON")

Business Process Monitor that uses Icinga as process health source. BPMON allows
you to compose *Business Processes* (BPs) and their *Key Performance Indicators*
(KPIs) using the services you already have in Icinga! BPMON ...

* ... *reads* the states of services defined, ...
* ... *evaluates* those states, ...
* ... feeds the results results to an InfluxDB in order to *keep track of the history* ...
* ... and/or triggers a command to perform actions such as *alarming*.

BPMON does not need to be run as a server. Run BPMON via Jenkins, Cron or
manually as needed.

## Install and Build
    # go get -u github.com/unprofession-al/bpmon/...

## Configure BPMOM

BPMONs global settings are configured via a simple config file written in YAML.
The config file can hold multiple *sections* (separat configurations) that enables 
a decent amount of flexibility in combination with YAMLs *anchors*. Let's have 
a look at an example:

    ---
    # The default section is - as suggested - read by default. Note the '&default'
    # notation; this is known an an 'anchor' and allows you to reuse the settings
    # in other sections...
    default: &default
      # First BPMON needs to have access to your Icinga2 API. Learn more on by 
      # reading the [docs](https://docs.icinga.com/icinga2/latest/doc/module/icinga2/chapter/icinga2-api).
      icinga:
        server: icinga.example.com

      # Also the connection to the InfluxDB is required in order to persist the

        # If a state is 'OK' only save it to InfluxDB if its an BP measurement 
        # (e.g. do not persist 'OK' states for KPIs and services for the sake of
        # a small amount of data). In that case BP 'OK' states are saved as 
        # 'heart beat' of BPMON.
        save_ok: [ BP ]
      # Define your office hours et al. according to your *service level 
      # agreements* (SLA). You can later reference them in your BP definitions.
